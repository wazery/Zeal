Overview and 2015 Objectives
===

Keeping up with the momentum of last year, when 11 Egyptian students have been accepted in GSoC 2013 program, we are willing to start this yearâ€™s program earlier and offer more in-depth sessions and events.
We suggest an initial format for this year program in this document. We think about it this
year in a format that resembles online courses for closed group of interested students, with videos, assignments and feedback. The next section suggests a set of topics and expected number of sessions to cover each topic. Accordingly, we expect volunteers from GSoC alumni to give these sessions. On the other hand we shall provide a communication platform for highly interested students to attend these sessions and interact asking their questions and providing their feedback.
