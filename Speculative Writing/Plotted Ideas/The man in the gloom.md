The plot so far!
===

A poor man whom his young daughter suffer from a cancer in one of her organs. He don't have money to spend on her medicine so he searched for jobs without any luck. Then after a very long time he finally found a job with a good salary in which he must leave earth for a planet in an off-world colony. This planet has no life of any kind on it. It is just a power station for this colony, no one goes to there or even pass by. This colony is consuming the planet resources to give it the power it needs, it also do a terraforming process on this planet to make it capable of holding life after many many years, and this planet is not the only one of this kind! There is no midday on this planet, it is full of darkness all the time! This man's job is to be a human brain on this planet! Nothing more! Just to behave in any unexpected conditions that might happen to the planet. Emotional behavior from a human might be necessary which machine's AI cannot afford. 

The odd thing about the planet is that it contains a gas that is somehow affects the brain in a way very similar to LSD. It's full of it! The man is wearing a special suit in his movements across the planet. Most of the time he sits in the central control cabinet. One time he decided to do a crazy thing! He changed the life support system to tolerate a percentage of that druggy gas to the cabinet and to his suit while walking across the planet. He did that out of being bored and depressed all the time of sitting there. He had to live about 12 years on that planet alone with nothing to do other than sitting in this control room, or walking across this gloomy planet. 

He had some visions and hallucinations from that gas, suddenly he saw his daughter aged a lot. When he left her she was only 12 years old, and now he is seeing her as a 22 years old girl. She has a strange and terrifying implanted organ that makes her look like a cyborg. He asked her what is that organ, and how is she 22 years old and he left her only for 2 years so far! She replied in the most strange explanation, at that exact moment something catastrophic happened on the planet, and the machines decided that they have nothing to do, and it's the time for him to take the decision to how to control that disaster................

Another Suggestion/Idea

He talked with her and she left him, this hallucinations continued to happen a lot till he falled in love with this woman whom he sees every time in this fake visions. His brain faked that love to get him out of this boring planet. Then something catastrophic happened on the planet, and the machines decided that they have nothing to do, and it's the time for him to take the decision for how to control that disaster, and unfortunately he is not in that mental condition that let him control anything, he is high with his loving dreams! ……………..

He used to his new life in the cyberspace. Around that he introduced to a lot of problems, one of which he got to love a real girl whom he known online on the cyberspace, and she didn’t know that he is just the consciousness of that dead man. She discovered that later.
